# python-curses 
(stop spoint)

### A python Rosary terminal app

* based on [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) UI layout

### Less whistles, bells, and bloat

_compared to my other previous DE versions:_

* no maze of ad-hoc calculations in this version, it is just a curses demo 
* just NAB english, I allready did the latin version in [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) and [electron-container](https://github.com/mezcel/electron-container)
* no extra content yet (feast days, web scrap daily mass, theme decoration, audio, refference guide), like in [jq-tput-terminal](https://github.com/mezcel/jq-tput-terminal) and [electron-container](https://github.com/mezcel/electron-container)
